Here you should have e second copy of conky.AppImage
The reason is that conky works properly with one update_indicator value.
But if we have 'update_indicator 2' on rss script we are DoS attacking the host... If conflict with something else also or if we change that 
value just because we dont know what is going on... we might lock out host rss server after ping attack...
So yes a conky script can be problem without user know it...
The safe choise I found was this.
A separate folder with one more copy o conky.AppImage inside and rssfile also was the only way to work properly.
